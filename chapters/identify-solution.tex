\section{Use appropriate methods and techniques to:}

Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pre-process `domain extensions' which compose together to produces a
  complete domain
\item Allows for different `people' to provide different parts of the domain
  \begin{itemize}
  \item `manager' provides
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The rules for combining together devices and middleware
    \item The problem to be solved,
      e.g. if it's the afternoon, then turn off the lights
    \end{itemize}
  \item `developer' provides
    \begin{itemize}
    \item drivers between device and system
    \item middleware combine together drivers into a common interface
    \item libraries to provide extra information and techniques, e.g. time library
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

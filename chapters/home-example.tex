\section{Problem File - p.prob}
This problem file describes a home with several lights in it as well as the
current hour of the day. The problem also specifies to run the `automate-house'
method first, this is where the user defined rules are.

\begin{lstlisting}
(defproblem
  [(hour 12)
   (light light1) (on light1)
   (light light2) (off light2)
   (light light3) (on light3)
   (light light4) (off light4)
   (light light5) (off light5)
   (light light6) (on light6)
   (light light7) (off light7)
   (light light8) (off light8)
   (light light9) (on light9)]
  [(automate-house)])
\end{lstlisting}

\section{User Defined rules - user-rules.dext}
This domain extension describes the rules that the manager would have configured
in the home automation system's user interface. In this case the rules are: if
it is the afternoon and there are some lights on, then turn all the lights off;
and if it is the morning or the evening and there are some lights off, then turn
all the lights on.

\begin{lstlisting}
[(:method (rule-1)
          (and (afternoon)
               (not
                (forall [?light]
                        (light ?light)
                        (off ?light))))
          [(!turn-off-all)]
          ()
          [])

 (:method (rule-2)
          (and (or (evening)
                   (morning))
               (not
                (forall [?light]
                        (light ?light)
                        (on ?light))))
          [(!turn-on-all)]
          ()
          [])

 (:method (automate-house)
          ()
          [(rule-1) (rule-2)])]
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Time Middleware - time.dext}
This domain extension describes a simple example of a middleware that provides
three axiom predicates for describing the time of day.

\begin{lstlisting}
[(:- (morning)
     (and (hour ?hour)
          (call > ?hour 0)
          (call < ?hour 6)))

 (:- (afternoon)
     (and (hour ?hour)
          (call >= ?hour 6)
          (call < ?hour 20)))

 (:- (evening)
     (and (hour ?hour)
          (call >= ?hour 20)
          (call < ?hour 24)))]
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Device Driver - light1.dext}
This domain extension describes a simple device driver to interface with the
lights configured in the system.

\begin{lstlisting}
[(:operator (!turn-on ?light)
            (and (light ?light)
                 (off ?light))
            [(off ?light)]
            [(on ?light)])

 (:operator (!turn-on-all)
            ()
            [(forall [?light]
                     (and (light ?light)
                          (off ?light))
                     [(off ?light)])]
            [(forall [?light]
                     (and (light ?light)
                          (off ?light))
                     [(on ?light)])])

 (:operator (!turn-off ?light)
            (and (light ?light)
                 (on ?light))
            [(on ?light)]
            [(off ?light)])

 (:operator (!turn-off-all)
            ()
            [(forall [?light]
                     (and (light ?light)
                          (on ?light))
                     [(on ?light)])]
            [(forall [?light]
                     (and (light ?light)
                          (on ?light))
                     [(off ?light)])])

 (:method (toggle-light-internal ?light)
          (on ?light)
          [(!turn-off ?light)]
          (off ?light)
          [(!turn-on ?light)])

 (:method (toggle-light ?light)
          (light ?light)
          [(toggle-light-internal ?light)])]

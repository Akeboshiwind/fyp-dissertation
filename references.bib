abstract = {Automated planning technology has become mature enough to be useful in applications that range from game playing to control of space vehicles. In this article, Dana Nau discusses where automated-planning research has been, where it is likely to go, where he thinks it should go, and some major challenges in getting there. The article is an updated version of Nau's invit- ed talk at AAAI-05 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.},

abstract = {In the actual era of smart homes and smart grids, advanced technological systems that allow the automation of domestic tasks are developing rapidly. There are numerous technologies and applications that can be installed in smart homes today. They enable communication between home appliances and users, and enhance home appliances' automation, monitoring and remote control capabilities. This review article, by introducing the concept of the smart home and the advent of the smart grid, investigates technologies for smart homes. The technical descriptions of the systems are presented and point out advantages and disadvantages of each technology and product today available on the market. Barriers, challenges, benefits and future trends regarding the technologies and the role of users have also been discussed.},

@article{Evans2011,
abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), sometimes referred to as the Internet of Objects, will change everything—including ourselves. This may seem like a bold statement, but consider the impact the Internet already has had on education, communication, business, science, government, and humanity. Clearly, the Internet is one of the most important and powerful creations in all of human history. Now consider that IoT represents the next evolution of the Internet, taking a huge leap in its ability to gather, analyze, and distribute data that we can turn into information, knowledge, and, ultimately, wisdom. In this context, IoT becomes immensely important. Already, IoT projects are under way that promise to close the gap between poor and rich, improve distribution of the world's resources to those who need them most, and help us understand our planet so we can be more proactive and less reactive. Even so, several barriers exist that threaten to slow IoT development, including the transition to IPv6, having a common set of standards, and developing energy sources for millions—even billions—of minute sensors. However, as businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia work together to solve these challenges, IoT will continue to progress. The goal of this paper, therefore, is to educate you in plain and simple terms so you can be well versed in IoT and understand its potential to change everything we know to be true today.},

@incollection{Cimatti2008,
abstract = {The term “planning” is a deliberation process that chooses and organizes actions by anticipating their expected effects. This deliberation aims at satisfying some predeﬁned requirements and achieving some prestated objectives. Automated Planning is the area of artificial intelligence (AI) that studies this deliberation process computationally. It aims is to support a planning activity by reasoning on conceptual models—that is, abstract and formal representations of a domain, of the effects and the combinations of actions, and of the requirements to be satisfied and the objectives to be achieved. The conceptual model of the domain in which actions are executed is called the “planning domain,” the combinations of actions are called “plans,” and the requirements to be satisfied are called “goals.” Intuitively, given a planning domain and a goal, a planning problem consists in determining a plan that satisfies the goal in the given domain. This chapter presents a general formal framework for automated planning that can model domains, plans, and goals. The chapter also discusses the state-of-the-art techniques in the field and some future research challenges.},
